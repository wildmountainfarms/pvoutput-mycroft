## PVOutput
Informs you about energy generation and consumption

##### NOTE: This is work in progress

## Description 
With this skill, you can ask Mycroft for the status of your solar panel system. You can ask it for today's
power generation or last week's energy consumption

## Examples 
* "How much energy have I used today?"
* "How much energy did I produce yesterday?"
* "How much power am I using right now?"
* "How much power are the solar panels generating?"
* "What is the voltage of my panels?"
* "What is the temperature of my panels?"
* "What was my peak power today?"
* "What was the minimum temperature of my panels today?"
* "What was the maximum temperature of my panels today?"
* "What was the average temperature of my panels today?"
