## PVOutput
Informs you about energy generation and consumption

## Description 
With this skill, you can ask Mycroft for the status of your solar panel system. 
This retrieves data from https://pvoutput.org. You can ask it for today's
energy generation or last week's energy consumption.

Recommended to be used with [SolarThing](https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing), which can upload data to PVOutput.
There are also [numerous other programs](https://github.com/topics/pvoutput) that can upload data to PVOutput.

This requires you to set up an account on https://pvoutput.org to get an API key.

## Examples 
* "How much energy have I used today?"
* "How much energy did I produce yesterday?"
* "How much energy did I generate last month?"
* "How much energy have I used this year?"
* "How much power am I using right now?"
* "How much power are the solar panels generating?"
* "What was my peak power today?"
